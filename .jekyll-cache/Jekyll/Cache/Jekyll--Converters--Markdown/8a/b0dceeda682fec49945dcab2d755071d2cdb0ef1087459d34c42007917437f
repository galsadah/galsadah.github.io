<h2 id="part-3-recap">Part #3 recap</h2>
<p>In part #3, we conducted descriptive analysis to examine the distribution of sample characteristics for our study. We provided a summary of the demographic characteristics, mental health outcomes, and binge drinking variables. In this post, we will continue our analysis and complete a logistic regression analysis to identify any significant predictors of negative mental health among veterans with disabilities in our sample.</p>

<h2 id="limitations--implications">Limitations &amp; Implications</h2>
<p>This study has limitations. First, this study is cross-sectional and we cannot infer causal relationships. Second, the population we selected is very specific and if we were to take more years it might give us more informative outcomes. Third, we identified (veterans with disabilites) by identifying disability variables and veteran variable. There is a difference between veterans with disabilities and disabled veterans. Therefore, if the study was conducted on disabled veterans, the analysis might have given us different results.</p>
