<h2 id="intro-to-alcohol-use-and-mental-health">Intro to alcohol use and mental health</h2>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that between 2011 and 2015, excessive alcohol use led to approximately 95,000 deaths costing the United States $249 billion between loss of workplace productivity, healthcare costs, and legal costs <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm/">(CDC, 2021).</a> Excessive alcohol consumption poses both long-term and short-term risks. 
Short-term or immediate dangers of excessive alcohol consumption include injuries from auto accidents, falls, and drowning as well as alcohol poisoning and becoming a victim of violence or homicide. Long-term risks include developing chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, heart disease, memory loss, and mental health issues to include depression and anxiety <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm/">(CDC, 2021).</a>
The CDC defines Excessive drinking as binge drinking, heavy drinking, and any drinking by pregnant women or people younger than age 21. Binge drinking is defined as consuming 4 or more drinks for a woman or 5 or more drinks for a man on an occasion during the past 30 days <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm/">(CDC, 2021).</a></p>

<h2 id="alcohol-use-in-veterans-with-disabilities">Alcohol use in veterans with disabilities</h2>
<p>To better understand the issue of alcohol use in veterans with disabilities as it relates to mental health, we first decided to briefly observe alcohol related challenges faced by each group (veterans and people with disabilities) independently. This is to provide us with some context into the background of both populations while simultaneously providing insight to the uniqueness of the challenges faced by veterans and people with disabilities.</p>

<p>The American with Disabilities ACT (ADA) defines a person with a disability as a person who has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities, a person who has a history or record of such an impairment, or a person who is perceived by others as having such an impairment <a href="https://www.ada.gov/cguide.htm#anchor62335/">(ADA.gov, 2020).</a></p>
