<h2 id="part-2-recap">Part #2 recap</h2>
<p>In part #2, we talked about the data source we are using for this project, which was the CDCâ€™s 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). We also specified the study sample (veterans with disabilities) and the variables we are interested in. Our research question is to assess whether there is an association between alcohol use and mental health outcomes in veterans with disabilities. In this post, we try to gain some insights about our study sample by conducting descriptive analysis to examine the demographic characteristics, mental health outcomes, and binge drinking among veterans with disabilities.</p>
