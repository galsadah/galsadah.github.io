<h2 id="part-3-recap">Part #3 recap</h2>
<p>In part #3, we conducted descriptive analysis to examine the distribution of sample characteristics for our study. We provided a summary of the demographic characteristics, mental health outcomes, and binge drinking variables. In this post, we will continue our analysis and complete a logistic regression analysis to identify any significant predictors of negative mental health among veterans with disabilities in our sample.</p>

<h2 id="limitations--implications">Limitations &amp; Implications</h2>
<p>This study has limitations. First, this study is cross-sectional and we cannot infer causal relationships. Second, the population we selected is very specific and if we were to take more years it might give us more informative outcomes. Third, we identified (veterans with disabilites) by identifying disability variables and veteran variable. There is a difference between veterans with disabilities and disabled veterans. Therefore, if the study was conducted on disabled veterans, the analysis might have given us different results.</p>

<p>Measuring HRQOL can help in determining the impact of alcohol use among veterans with disabilities. Additional evidence is needed to understand how alcohol use can impact mental health outcomes for veterans with disabilities. This study builds on existing knowledge by using new data from the 2020 BRFSS to yeild a national sample.</p>
