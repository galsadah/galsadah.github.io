<p>The data we will be using is the 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) which is a cross-sectional annual telephone survey in the United States. It is conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and health departments to collect behavioral health risk data from adult U.S. residents on their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and preventive service use. BRFSS questionnaire includes (1) core questions (which are asked by all states), (2) optional modules (which are based on specific topics), and (3) state-added questions <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/data_documentation/pdf/UserguideJune2013.pdf">CDC, 2013</a>.</p>
